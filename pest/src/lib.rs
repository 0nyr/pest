//! # pest. The Elegant Parser
//!
//! pest is a [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) parser built with
//! *simplicity* and *speed* in mind.
//!
//! ## Input & Parser
//!
//! pest works mainly through two `trait`s: `Input` & `Parser`. `Input` defines the capabilities of
//! an input source, while `Parser` provides an interface to the parsing functionality. Since
//! `Parser` is a `trait`, parsing needs to be defined either though the `#[derive(Parser)]`
//! attribute, or manually through the [`Position API`](inputs/struct.Position.html). The use of the
//! `derive` is highly encouraged since this is the only way you can make use of the pest's PEG
//! grammar, while manual parser definition can be used where highly specific or efficient parsing
//! is required.
//!
//! ## `#[derive(Parser)]`
//!
//! pest comes with a procedural macro crate--`pest_derive`--which needs to be included in
//! `Cargo.toml` order to enable the `derive`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! pest_derive = "*"
//! ```
//!
//! ## `.pest` files
//!
//! Grammar definitions reside in custom `.pest` files located in the `src` directory. Their path is
//! relative to `src` and is specified between the `derive` attribute and empty `struct` that
//! `Parser` will be derived on.
//!
//! Because of a limitation in procedural macros, there is no way for Cargo to know that a module
//! needs to be recompiled based on the file that the procedural macro is opening. This leads to the
//! case where modifying a `.pest` file without touching the file where the `derive` is does not
//! recompile it if it already has a working binary in the cache. To avoid this issue, the grammar
//! file can be included in a dummy `const` definition while debugging.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! const _GRAMMAR: &'static = include_str!("path/to/my_grammar.pest"); // relative to this file
//!
//! #[derive(Parser)]
//! #[grammar = "path/to/my_grammar.pest"] // relative to src
//! struct MyParser;
//! ```
//!
//! The grammar of `.pest` files is documented in the
//! [`pest_derive` crate](https://docs.rs/pest_derive/#Grammar).
